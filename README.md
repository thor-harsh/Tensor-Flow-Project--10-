**In this project we'll be applying Natural Language Processing to solve PubMed RCT (PubMed 200k RCT):<br></br>
**Let's looks into dataset:** <br></br>

**About Dataset**: <br>
PubMed 200k RCT is new dataset based on PubMed for sequential sentence classification. The dataset consists of approximately 200,000 abstracts of randomized controlled trials, totaling 2.3 million sentences. Each sentence of each abstract is labeled with their role in the abstract using one of the following classes: background, objective, method, result, or conclusion. 
The purpose of releasing this dataset is twofold.First, the majority of datasets for sequential short-text classification (i.e., classification of short texts that appear in sequences) are small: the authors hope that releasing a new large dataset will help develop more accurate algorithms for this task. Second, from an application perspective, researchers need better tools to efficiently skim through the literature.
Automatically classifying each sentence in an abstract would help researchers read abstracts more efficiently, especially in fields where abstracts may be long, such as the medical field.<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand what is TensorFlow and What is Classification problem and What do we actually understand by Natural Lanuage Processing**...<br></br>

**What is a TensorFlow?** <br></br>

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It was developed by the Google Brain team for Google's internal use in research and production. <br></br>

**What is a Natural Language Processing?** <br></br>

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning to enable computers to understand and communicate with human language.  <br></br>

**What is a Classification?** <br></br>

Classification is a supervised machine learning process of categorizing a given set of input data into classes based on one or more variables. <br></br>
